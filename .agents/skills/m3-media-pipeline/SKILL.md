# M3 — Media pipeline

**Blocked until decision D3 (hosting and storage provider) is made.** If it is still open in `docs/decisions.md`, stop and ask the owner. Meanwhile a local-disk adapter is fine for development.

## Do
1. **Storage abstraction**: an interface (`put`, `getUrl`, `delete`) with a local-disk adapter for dev and one adapter for the chosen provider. Never store binary files in the database. Store metadata in `MediaAsset` (random `storageKey`, mime, bytes, width, height, `altText`, status).
2. **Upload endpoint**: authenticated by the edit secret, rate limited. Validate by magic bytes (JPEG, PNG, WebP; no SVG/GIF unless approved), enforce max bytes and max pixels **before decoding**, cap the number of images per experience.
3. **Processing** (e.g. `sharp`): re-encode, resize to sensible maximums, generate a small preview size, **strip all metadata including GPS EXIF**, ignore the user's filename.
4. **Editor UX**: upload progress, retry, remove, reorder, alt text field, friendly errors for wrong type, too large, network failure.
5. **Renderer**: templates receive resolved media with explicit dimensions. Missing or deleted media falls back gracefully; no broken-image icons ever reach the recipient.
6. **Cleanup**: remove media when an experience is deleted or a draft image is removed, plus a script or job for orphaned uploads. Document the strategy.
7. **Tests**: valid upload; wrong type disguised by extension; oversized bytes; oversized pixels; corrupt file; metadata stripped (assert no EXIF in output); missing media rendering; e2e upload -> preview -> publish -> public page.

## Gate
A real user's photos flow safely from upload to preview to published page on mobile and desktop. Security review done. Checkpoint report posted.
