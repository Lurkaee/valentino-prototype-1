## The Concept

Valentino is designed for moments that matter. Rather than sending a generic card or an unformatted text message, creators can build an intimate, personal web experience in seconds—with zero sign-up friction.

The experience is centered around two distinct perspectives:

* **The Creator:** Discovers templates, tailors romantic notes and personal greetings, watches changes reflected instantly in a desktop/mobile live preview, and publishes with a single click. Edits remain private to the creator's browser session via cryptographically secure, passwordless credentials.
* **The Recipient:** Receives a private, unguessable link. Opening it presents an uninterrupted, cinematic experience—such as an envelope sealed with digital wax—optimized specifically for mobile screens and in-app chat browsers.

```
Discover Template → Customize & Style → Live Real-Time Preview → Instant Publish → Private Recipient Reveal
```

## Architectural Highlights

* **Single-Engine Rendering Contract:** The exact same template component and normalization pipeline powers both the creator's real-time editor preview (`mode="preview"`) and the recipient's public view (`mode="public"`). What you see while drafting is byte-for-byte what your partner sees.
* **Zero-Sign-Up Security:** Creators do not need to create an account or provide an email. Authorization is handled via 256-bit cryptographic edit secrets hashed with HMAC-SHA256 and stored in secure, scoped HTTP-only `__Host-` cookies.
* **Privacy by Default:** Public Valentine links are unindexed (`noindex, nofollow`), send strict `Cache-Control: no-store` headers, and feature high-entropy 128-bit unguessable identifiers.
* **Optimistic Concurrency:** Drafts enforce integer revision tracking (`draftRevision`) to safeguard against accidental overwrites or multi-tab race conditions.
* **Automated Live Delivery:** Integrated into Vercel with automatic branch preview deployments and zero-downtime production database migrations via Prisma and PostgreSQL.

## Included Templates

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Framework** | [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router, Node.js runtime) | Server Route Handlers, high-performance static/dynamic rendering |
| **Language** | [TypeScript 5](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (Strict Mode) | End-to-end type safety across schemas, API routes, and components |
| **Styling** | [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) | Curated dark romantic aesthetic, glassmorphism, responsive utility system |
| **Persistence** | [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) + [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) | Type-safe queries, migration tracking, and relational consistency |
| **Validation** | [Zod](https://zod.dev/) | Strict server-authoritative schema validation with Unicode grapheme boundary support |
| **Testing** | [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) + [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) | Unit, integration, optimistic concurrency, and end-to-end browser suites |

## Quickstart & Local Development

### Prerequisites
* **Node.js**: `v20+` or `v24+`
* **Package Manager**: `pnpm v9+`
* **Database**: Local or cloud PostgreSQL instance

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lurkaee/valentino-prototype-1.git
cd valentino-prototype-1
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:
```ini
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/valentino_dev"
APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
EDIT_SECRET_PEPPER="replace-with-a-random-32-character-secret-string"
```

### 3. Database Initialization
Apply existing migrations to your local database and generate the Prisma Client:
```bash
pnpm prisma migrate deploy
pnpm prisma generate
```

### 4. Start Development Server
```bash
pnpm dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Verification & Quality Gates

The codebase enforces strict linting, typechecking, and multi-tier test suites:

```bash
# Run ESLint validation
pnpm lint

# Run TypeScript compiler typecheck
pnpm typecheck

# Run unit and integration tests (Vitest)
pnpm test

# Run end-to-end browser test suite (Playwright)
pnpm test:e2e

# Run production build verification
pnpm build
```
