# Decisions

## Settled

### ADR-0001 — Stack
- **Decision**: TypeScript, Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL + Prisma, Zod, pnpm, Vitest, Playwright. Modular monolith.
- **Context**: Greenfield prototype, solo owner, needs SSR/ISR for fast public pages and one language across client and server.
- **Options**: Vite SPA + separate API; Remix; Next.js full-stack.
- **Reason**: One codebase, server components keep the public page light, mature tooling.
- **Tradeoffs**: Framework coupling; some Next.js conventions to learn. Revisit only with owner approval.

### ADR-0002 — Vertical slice first
- **Decision**: Milestones M0–M6 build one working end-to-end slice (M1) before extracting the template system, adding media, and building the gallery.
- **Reason**: Routing, persistence, and the shared-renderer contract get proven early instead of after many horizontal phases.
- **Mapping to the original 11 phases**: M0 = Phase 0; M1 = thin 1+4+5+7; M2 = Phase 2; M3 = Phase 6; M4 = Phase 3 + landing; M5 = Phase 8; M6 = Phases 9+10.

### ADR-0003 — Antigravity configuration layout
- **Decision**: Short always-on `AGENTS.md` + `.agents/rules/` for standing rules; milestone procedures as Skills in `.agents/skills/`; reviewers as subagents in `.agents/agents/`.
- **Reason**: Rules files are capped at 12,000 characters each. Antigravity's Workflows are deprecated and scheduled to retire on 2026-11-01 in favor of Skills, which also load on demand instead of bloating every prompt.
### ADR-0004 — Anonymous Cookie-Based Edit Sessions
- **Decision**: No user accounts in M1. The creator authenticates via an HttpOnly, SameSite, Secure (in production, `__Host-` prefixed) cookie named per-experience (`__Host-edit-token-[publicId]` in prod, `edit-token-[publicId]` in local dev). The server verifies that the credential matches the keyed HMAC-SHA-256 hash (`editCredentialHash`) for the requested experience.
- **Session Lifetime**: 90-day sliding inactivity lifetime, strictly capped at 180 days absolute from `editCredentialIssuedAt` (enforced server-side). Browser cookie expiry ≠ server-side credential validity.
- **Recovery**: M1 does not implement recovery links or magic links; an editor reminder banner informs the creator that edit access is saved in this browser. Architecture remains recovery-ready with `editCredentialHash` and `editCredentialVersion`.
- **Reason**: Lowest friction for prototype creators while maintaining strict security without credential leaks.

### ADR-0005 — Separate Draft/Published State with Optimistic Revisions
- **Decision**: `draftConfig` and `publishedConfig` are isolated. The public route `/v/[publicId]` renders `publishedConfig` only and ignores edit cookies entirely.
- **Concurrency**: Draft saves require `baseRevision` and increment `draftRevision` (409 Conflict on mismatch). Publish requires `expectedRevision`, validates against a strict schema, and creates the published snapshot inside a single atomic database transaction.
- **Reason**: Prevents unfinished edits from reaching recipients, protects against lost updates across tabs/concurrent saves, and ensures published state is deterministic.

### ADR-0006 — Public Route Caching Strategy (M1 no-store)
- **Decision**: In M1, `/v/*`, `/edit/*`, and `/api/*` send `Cache-Control: no-store`. No public caching, ISR, revalidation, or CDN caching is introduced in M1.
- **Reason**: Eliminates the risk of serving stale recipient content following a republish, disable, or deletion. Public caching and CDN revalidation will be evaluated during M5 and decided in M6 after a thorough privacy and invalidation review. LCP measurements in M1 are informational evidence only.

## Open (owner decides; agent asks, never guesses)

| ID | Decision | Recommended default | Needed by |
|----|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| D1 | Public product name. "Valentino" is also a well-known fashion brand, so consider a different public name later. Repo codename is fine. | Keep codename for the prototype | Before any public launch |
| D2 | Creator identity: accounts vs. no accounts | **Settled in ADR-0004** (No accounts; cookie-based session per experience) | Settled M1 |
| D3 | Hosting, database host, media storage provider | Decide after M2 | M3 |
| D4 | Personalized link previews (name in Open Graph) | Generic previews only (privacy: crawlers and chat apps cache them) | M5 |
| D5 | Link lifetime | Live until the creator deletes; optional expiry later | M1/M6 |
| D6 | License | None while the repo is private | Before making the repo public |
| D7 | Audio/music support | Out of scope for the prototype | Later |
